# Project Name
> BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has faced revenue declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic and 
> seeks to develop a strategic business plan to boost revenue post-lockdown. 
> They aim to understand the factors influencing bike demand to better prepare and differentiate
> themselves in the market. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset on daily bike demands, 
> they hope to identify significant variables and their impact on demand, enabling informed business 
> decisions and improved customer satisfaction.

## General Information
- This is Programming Assignment. 
- Model the demand for shared bikes using available independent variables to help management understand demand variations and inform business strategy.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
The top 5 variables that are seen effecting and benefitting the Bike Rental count are as follows:

1. Temperature : 0.549936
2. Year : 0.233056
3. Light Snow : -0.288021
4. Windspeed : -0.155238
5. winter : 0.131826

#### Recommendations 
 
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes can focus more on Temperature. 

- We can see demand for bikes was more in 2019 than 2018, so just focus as there is increase in 2019 and might be facing dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic and by the time it reduces the things will be better

- Can focus more on Summer & Winter season, August, September month, Weekends, Working days as they have good influence on bike rentals.

- The company should focus on the months of January, July, September, November, and December, as they experience higher demand compared to other months.

- Additionally, demand tends to increase with rising temperatures, so monitoring weather conditions is crucial.

- During the winter season, demand also surges, so the company should be well-prepared to meet this high demand.
